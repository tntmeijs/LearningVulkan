# LearningVulkan
Just a place where I can dump code I used to learn the Vulkan API.
You are free to use the code in this repository, however, it is probably a terrible idea to do so.

## PLEASE NOTE
This repository was *never* meant to be cross-platform.
I develop on Windows, so I did not take the time to implement Linux / Apple support.
You are more than welcome to do so, though.
